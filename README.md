Outpainting an image 



This project involves extending a 1024x1024 image by adding 128 pixels to each side, resulting in a final size of 1280x1280 pixels. The primary objective is to ensure that the new pixels added seamlessly blend with the original image, creating a natural-looking extension. Using Python and libraries such as Pillow and NumPy, the project creates a new canvas, places the original image at the center, and fills the surrounding area to achieve a cohesive and extended image. This approach lays the groundwork for using more advanced techniques or models to refine the outpainting process further.
