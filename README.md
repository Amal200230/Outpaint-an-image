Outpainting an image 
Overview
This project involves outpainting an image, which means extending its borders by adding additional pixels around it. The goal is to add 128 pixels to each side of a 1024x1024 image, making the final size 1280x1280 pixels. The new pixels should seamlessly blend with the original image to create a natural extension.

Features
•	Image Extension: Adds 128 pixels to each side of the original image.
•	Preserved Content: The original image is centered, and the added pixels should blend naturally.
Libraries such as “numpy” and  “pillow” are used in this project.
•	Pillow is used for opening and saving images.
•	NumPy is used for handling image data as arrays.

This project involves extending a 1024x1024 image by adding 128 pixels to each side, resulting in a final size of 1280x1280 pixels. The primary objective is to ensure that the new pixels added seamlessly blend with the original image, creating a natural-looking extension. Using Python and libraries such as Pillow and NumPy, the project creates a new canvas, places the original image at the center, and fills the surrounding area to achieve a cohesive and extended image. This approach lays the groundwork for using more advanced techniques or models to refine the outpainting process further.
